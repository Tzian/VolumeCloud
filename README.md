# VolumeCloud
This is a WIP volumetric cloud effect, still pretty rough.<br>
Most comments were written in Chinese at first, I have translated most of them, but there are maybe still some Chinese comments exist but I think that doesn't affect reading the code. <br>
During the process I referenced this tutorial, it uses a sceneviewFilter script to display the image effect on editor window so that it can be more convenient for debugging:<br>http://flafla2.github.io/2016/10/01/raymarching.html<br>
